Dumping games both for CFW and HEN are the same way using multiMAN app. But there’s two ways, one if you want to dump only one game. And the other if you want to dump multiple games at once.


## Once a time

Go to the game you want and click /\ (Triangle) button on it. And select “Copy” and then select your USB Flash Drive.


## File Manager

This method allows you to dump multiple games at once. Simply go to multiMAN settings, and launch the file manager.

- Go to this directory: `dev_hdd0\GAMES` if your games are on “JB Folder” format.
- Go to this directory: `dev_hdd0\PS3ISO` if your games are on “ISO” format.
- Go to this directory: `dev_hdd0\game` if your games are on “PKG” format.

Simply copy the games you want to your USB Flash Drive.


## Copying Dumped Games

Saving a PS3 dumped games is a good way to save space, if you want to return them in it place to play them again simply either Go to the game you want and click /\ (Triangle) button on it. And select “Copy”, or 

- Go to this directory: `dev_hdd0\GAMES` if your games are on “JB Folder” format, and copy your game here.

    - Or install it if you dumped it as a PKG file.
