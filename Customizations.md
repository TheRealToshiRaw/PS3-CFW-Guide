# Customizing 

You can customize your PS3 by many different ways. I didn't covered them all here, if you want to see more you see this **[page](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS3:Custom_Themes,_Fonts,_and_XMB_Waves)**.


## Boot Icon

If you don't like the CFW, or HEN icon while booting your console you can basically change and restore it to the default by installing this **[PKG-file for CFW](https://github.com/ZHassanQ/PS3-Guide/releases/download/Others/Restore_Official_Coldboot_dev_blind-CFW.pkg)**, or this **[PKG-file for HEN](https://github.com/ZHassanQ/PS3-Guide/releases/download/Others/Restore_Official_Coldboot_dev_rewrite-HEN.zip)** and it will be back as it was.
