# Customizing 

You can customize your PS3 by many different ways. I didn't covered them all here, if you want to see more you see this **[page](https://consolemods.org/wiki/PS3:Custom_Themes,_Fonts,_and_XMB_Waves)**.


## Boot Icon

If you don't like the CFW, or HEN icon while booting your console you can basically change and restore it to the default by installing this **[PKG-file for CFW]()**, or this **[PKG-file for HEN]()** and it will be back as it was.
